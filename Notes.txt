Code:
RastersII: the stack function from the raster package must to be ran as raster::stack to avoid namespaces clashes. This is a knitr problem and at the final edition of the book, the function should be changed from raster::stack to stack, either manually on the .md file or directly if the bug is fixed in a future knitr version.
