# Problem
You want to read a shapefile.

# Solution
The ``rgdal`` package has the function ``readOGR()`` to read shapefiles:

```r
> library(rgdal)
```

```
Loading required package: sp
rgdal: version: 0.8-16, (SVN revision 498)
Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 1.10.1, released 2013/08/26
Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal/1.10
Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012, [PJ_VERSION: 480]
Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected)
```

```r
> cities <- readOGR('../../Data', 'cities')
```

```
OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
Source: "../../Data", layer: "cities"
with 606 features and 4 fields
Feature type: wkbPoint with 2 dimensions
```
The ``maptools`` package also has functions to read shapefiles:

```r
> library(maptools)
```

```
Checking rgeos availability: FALSE
 	Note: when rgeos is not available, polygon geometry 	computations in maptools depend on gpclib,
 	which has a restricted licence. It is disabled by default;
 	to enable gpclib, type gpclibPermit()
```

```r
> cities <- readShapeSpatial('../../Data/cities')
```


# Discussion
The Esri [shapefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), or simply a shapefile, is a popular geospatial vector data format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information. A shapefile is a set of files. Three individual files are mandatory to store the core data that comprise a shapefile: .shp, .shx, and .dbf. There are further optional files which store primarily index data to improve performance. All files should be located in the same folder.  

When using ``readOGR()`` to read ``cities.shp`` located at ``~/Data (windows: C:/Data)``, define the ``dsn`` argument as the path and the ``layer`` argument as the name of the file without extension. For example: ``readOGR('~/Data', "cities")``. If the shapefile is in the current working directory, an equivalent function call is: ``readOGR('.', "cities")``. See ``?readOGR`` for a detailed description of available arguments.  

With ``readShapeSpatial()``, use ``readShapeSpatial('~/Data/cities')`` to read ``cities.shp`` located at ``~/Data (windows: C:/Data)``. If the shapefile is in the current working directory, an equivalent function call is: ``readShapeSpatial('cities')``. The maptools package also has specific functions for each vector data type: ``readShapePoints()``, ``readShapePoly()`` and ``readShapeLines()``. ``readShapeSpatial()`` can be used instead of the previous three functions. See ``?readShapeSpatial`` for a detailed description of available arguments.
